# Memories Back Then

## &#x1f4a1; Motivation
* It's  not oblivious that the year 2020 was filled with so much trauma and pain, however, it was also filled with many memories that'll last forever. I created this app for users to share their favorite memory/memories of 2020 with other users, with hopes of forming a community and sense of togetherness. 

## 	&#x1f511; Features 
* Some of the apps main/key features are
** A User has the ability to log into the app, using their google email through the implementation of Google Oauth
** A User then has the ability to see all the memories that were added to the platform including theirs
** With the click of a button, A User can upload a memory
** A User can only view the details of their own memory
** A User can update their memory if a mistake was made or they just dont like what they wrote
** A User can delete their memory all together if they dont want the memory to exist of the platform at all
